HELLO EVERYONE I OMPRASAD TILAK MADE A CHATBOT USING LLAMA MODEL , STREAMLIT AND REPLICATE API 
REPLICATE API IS A PAID PLATFORM BUT I AM USING A DEMO API KEY IN THIS WHICH IS FREE 
THIS REPLICATE API ALLOWS US TO USE OPEN SOURCE MODELS LIKE LLAMA , MISTRAL , FALCON AND etc.
YOU JUST HAVE TO GENERATE YOUR OWN KEY AND PASTE IT IN THE API KEY SECTION 
WHEN YOU RUN THE FILE
THIS ONLY FOR DEMONSTRATION OF USING OPEN SOURCE LLMS USING REPLICATE API TO CREATE A CHATBOT
